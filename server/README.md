# REST API 

Rest API was created using STRAPI API, and the database was integrated into Cloud SQL in Google Cloud Platform. 
Then the API was deployed to Cloud Run for endpoint communication with Mobile Application

# Deploying ML Model

The model will be deployed to an App Engine and Flask API will also be used as the endpoint for Mobile App to connect to the Machine Learning Model
